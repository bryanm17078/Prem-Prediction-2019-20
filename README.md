# Prem-Prediction-2019-20
Predict the 2019-20 Premier League in Python.

I used a machine learning algorithm (logisitic regression) to predict the result of the remaining premier league fixtures and the final premier league table.

These goals present a unique real-world Machine Learning prediction problem and involve solving various Machine Learning tasks: data integration, feature modelling and outcome prediction.


# Aims
Use Machine Learning to predict the winner of the premier league and the final premier league table(win,loss and draws).

Predict the outcome of individual matches for the entire competition.

Run simulation of the remaining fixtures.

The aims present a unique real-world Machine Learning prediction problem and involve solving various Machine Learning tasks: data wrangling, feature extraction and outcome prediction.

# Dataset
I used dataset from football-data,kaggle and soccersoda for the premier league games that were played,the remaining fixtures and the historical premier league games dataset.
Taking care to remove games that  where either team were not in the current premier league season from the historical dataset as I didn't want those result to add weight and potentially bias the model.

# Environment and tools
Python 2.7

Jupyter Notebook

Numpy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression)


## According to the model Liverpool will win the premier league,Watford, Sheffield and Brighton will be relegated.

# Areas of further Improvement

A confusion matrix would be great to analyse which games the model got wrong.

Include more measurements in our dataset that may affect or influence the result e.g. expected goals,injuries and quality of the player
